Game Piece Descriptions for KerPlop

1. Archer
- Extends: GamePiece
- Implements: Moveable
- InteractionResult: 
	- Will HIT the player if within three squares from player 
	- Will KILL if on same square as the player
- Movement: Moves away and to the player using the pattern {away, to, away, to, to}
- Notes: Moves in a repeating sequence every turn.

2. Guard
- Extends: GamePiece
- Implements: Moveable
- InteractionResult: 
	- Will HIT the player if on adjacent square to the player
	- Will KILL if on same square as the player
- Movement: Randomly chooses to move left or right by 1 step, or not move at all
- Notes: Introduces luck based challenge due to random motion.

3. King
- Extends: GamePiece
- Implements: (none)
- InteractionResult: Will ADVANCE the player if the player lands on its location
- Movement: (none)
- Notes: Reaching this piece allows the player to advance a level.

4. Door
- Extends: GamePiece
- Implements: (none)
- InteractionResult: Randomized with probabilites being 45% GET_POINT, 5% ADVANCE, and 55% HIT
- Movement: (none)
- Notes: Interaction result chosen by weighted random probability. Can advance early if lucky enough. 

5. Room
- Extends: GamePiece
- Implements: (none)
- InteractionResult: Randomized with probabilites being 20% HIT, 20% GET_POINT, 5% KILL, and 55% NONE
- Movement: (none)
- Notes: Interaction result chosen by weighted random probability. Can KILL if unlucky enough.

6. Window
- Implements: Drawable
- InteractionResult: (none)
- Movement: (none)
- Notes: Surves as a decoratation. Only a visual element for players theorize about. Might be explored in the sequel.

Level Setup Summary:
- 2 levels defined using a character-to-piece mapping system
- Levels defined in `LevelSetup.java` using hardcoded layouts:
    Level 1: "_A_____DRWD__G___K___"
    Level 2: "KG_RD__D__R__G_______"

Requirements Completed:
1. At least 5 interactive pieces implemented
2. All required `InteractionResult` types are used:
	- HIT used by Archer, Guard, Door, and Room
    - GET_POINT used by Door and Room
    - KILL used by Room and Guard
    - ADVANCE used by King and Door
    - NONE (All GamePieces when not in range, Room sometimes when in range)
3. At least 2 pieces implement Moveable: 
	- Archer
	- Guard
4. Different move algorithms:
	- Archer uses deterministic pattern
	- Guard uses randomness
5. At most 3 pieces interact only on same square.
6. Door and Room provide distance interaction with a probabilistic design.
7. Window is purely Drawable.
8. Two levels have been implemented.
